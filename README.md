# Feel-weatherWatchOS2App
The beginning of the watchOS 2 app project that displays today's weather compared to what it felt like yesterday. 

The app uses API data from the [ForecastIO](https://developer.forecast.io/) and currently displays the weather summary for today, the temperature in Fahrenheit and a cute emoji to give you a quick context of today's weather. A user can click the Refresh button to update the weather information. 

Next step: 

* request info about user's location and display the weather data based on user's location; 
* design UI.
