# Feel - weather watchOS 2 App
This is the beginning of the watchOS app project that displays today's weather compared to what it felt like yesterday. 

The app uses [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) library and data from the [ForecastIO](https://developer.forecast.io/) API. 

The app currently displays:
* today's weather description, 
* temperature in Fahrenheit,
* emoji that gives you a quick context of today's weather. 

A user can click the Refresh button to update the weather information.

Next steps: 

* request info about user's location and display the weather data based on user's location; 
* design and implement UI based on the wireframe mockup; 
* implement features based on the wireframe mockup.
