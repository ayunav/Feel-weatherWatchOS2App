# Feel-weatherWatchOS2App
This is the beginning of the watchOS 2 app project that displays today's weather compared to what it felt like yesterday. 

The app uses data from the [ForecastIO](https://developer.forecast.io/) API and currently displays the weather summary for today, the temperature in Fahrenheit and a cute emoji to give you a quick context of today's weather. A user can click the Refresh button to update the weather information.

Next step: 

* request info about user's location and display the weather data based on user's location; 
* design UI based on the wireframe mockup; 
* implement features based on the wireframe mockup.
